think the guy in the carrage is talking to an AI girlfriend, hes talking about how good milkshakes and how he do almost anyting for a milkshake, also mentiuons how galway mayo and cork are big counties bigger than dublin and louth, and that you should by games from bulgaria becase you get them cheaper but they still work in eu on ps5, i dont know its on the other end of earphones, hes going on about how airpods are too expensive and he will only buy cheap ones from shops that sell vapes, he sounds exacly like <span class="hold-to-show" data-img="/assets/images/irish-tiktok-man.jpg">that irish tiktok man</span>, i dont know it jsut strikes me that hes talking to a LLM
